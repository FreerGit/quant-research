# General learnings about hedging
* Say the momentum of one of my investments is clearly losing momentum/coming into resistance and im looking to reduce exposure, the difference between selling the remove delta is quite significant to adding a hedge from a taxation perspective. Selling will of course realise a gain, say that it is clear the move of the asset is not done and I would like to get back the delta then I have to re-purchase said asset. This means in the future I now a tax burden that I have to accout for. Instead I could eat the premium of a hedge or simply remove it at a slight loss, thus regaining the delta. However now I can now take the realised loss and actually subtract from taxes. Of course I would have to sell the asset eventually but selling/repurchasing over the course of a bullrun versus buying and then adding/removing hedges can be more effective.

# Hedging vs Diverisifying
Papers looks at the difference between hedging with a 1 year 15 delta put on the SPX and quarterly rebalance vs normie 60/40 portfolio. Could a portfolio with 97.5% exposure to the SPX with a 2.5% put hedge be competative with 60/40?
* Delta refers to the change in value of the option depending on the  movement of the underlying. If delta is 0.5 or in this context 50, then a 1 point move in the underlying would produce a 50% change in the value of the option (assuming no decay etc)
* One problem with diversification is that in a market crash, due to liquidity issues, all markets trend to 1 in correlation. We can see this today where everything is going down from "safe" bonds to crypto markets.
* "The tendency for the S&P 500 to rally after a negative 
opex return cycle is much higher than the tendency for the S&P 500 to fall following a positive 
opex return cycle. "
* "The takeaway from the last four years is that investors have been able to increase their exposure 
to risky assets, hedge them directly with strategies like a protective put, and obtain better risk 
adjusted  returns  than  traditional  asset  allocation  models.  Given  the  backdrop  of  low  interest 
rates  and  potential  for  higher-than-average  inflation  in  the  future,  investors  should  consider 
these tradeoffs carefully in their asset allocation. "
