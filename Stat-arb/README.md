## Bayesian Markov Regime Switching
A markov-chain is a stochastic process (random process), the key characteristics of markov-chain is "transition probabilities", the likelihood that the current regime/state stays the same or changes.

The complete Markov-switching model includes:

* An assumed number of regimes.
* A dependent variable.
* Independent variables.
* Parameters relating the dependent variable to the independent variables for each regime.
* Transition probabilities.
* Statistical inferences on the model parameters and the determined states.

Advantage of useing Bayesian Markov regime shifting is that, instead of assuming a pair is cointegrated globally over the time series it can switch of locally under non-cointegrated regimes.

LMAO.... got to the math part and... yikes
