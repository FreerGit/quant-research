## Six Degrees of Idiocy
Complete idiot = poker player that only bets high on good hands and bets low/folds on bad hands while slumping/smiling
One step down = player that does the exact opposite in hopes of "tricking" opponent
* in both situations you are giving away complete information about your hand, no matter how many layers deep you take the flip flop of "I have a weak hand and I will act the opposite" or "I have a weak hand and I will act weak because my oppponent will think I am doing the opposite" etc
two steps down = show no emotion/poker face/revealing nothing

In finance the complete idiot would be someone that always chases the highest returns at the time, the highest yielding bond, the stock with the highest return this month etc.    

One step down would then be the person that does the exact opposite, only buys the worst performing stock of the month hoping it will turn into the best next month "Everyone else is chasing the highest  yeilding one this month so I will buy the "underpriced" one"

"The simplest way for an investor to be two
degrees removed from a complete idiot is to buy a
low cost, well-diversified index fund. There are
more sophisticated second-degree strategies like
Black-Litterman or Markowitz optimization that
attempt to integrate a variety of factors in a con-
sistent theoretical framework. This is the lowest
degree at which we are practicing finance.
A complete idiot does not consider other peo-
ple, someone one degree removed from a com-
plete idiot considers other people, but assumes
those other people are all complete idiots. To be
two degrees removed from a complete idiot you
not only have to consider the reactions of com-
plete idiots and one-degree thinkers, you have to
make the conceptual leap that at least some
other people are thinking at the same level you
are. Second-degree solutions are equilibrium
solutions. Moving to the third or higher degree,
in poker as well as finance, requires considera-
tion of non-equilibrium factors in other people,
such as learning"

"... This is the one with the strongest parallel
to finance. We can be greedy, and play the
strongest hands, but we avoid the hands just a little bit worse.
These hands are overplayed and
have negative expectation, even though they win
more than 10 per cent of the time in a table of ten
players. Unless we’re playing undisciplined com-
plete idiots, we’ll mix in some weaker hands.
We’ll choose those hands carefully to balance
some degree of strength (two middle cards, one
high card or a pair) with good playing qualities
against the likely other hands, and surprise value"
